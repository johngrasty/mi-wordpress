Wordpress with FastCGI + Nginx + opcache

## Overview
A Wordpress MIBE repo that builds a very fast Wordpress dedicated vps environment. Compiled with Nginx 1.7.4, FastCGI Cache Purge and Geoip support. Configured with MySQL Percona and php-fpm using opcache. Will auto-tune my.cnf in relation to zone memory size at the time of provisioning. 

All pages are statically cached and purged from the cache when a page/post is changed or updated. Extremely efficient - configured to serve hundreds of concurrent Wordpress requests at blazing speeds with minimal CPU or Database Load.

Unique Passwords are generated for MySQL root user as well as wordpress database. All information is passed into /etc/motd after zone init.

## metadata support
Certain metadata passed to the JSON payload file at creation time will dictate how the new wordpress instance is configured. Currently Supported Metadata:

    wpsite_url - wordpress site url
    wphome_url - wordpress home url
    wpadmin_usr - wordpress admin user
    wpadmin_psw - wordpress admin password
    wpadmin_ema - wordpress admin password
If no metadata is passed then default username and password will be used for wordpress admin user:
      
      Admin User: wpadmin
      Admin Password: wppass
      Admin Email: admin@site.local
example:  [Project FiFo Metadata in use](http://abn.me/mdata "metadata screenshot")
result:  [Custom Machine Provisioned](http://abn.me/mdresu "metadata result screenshot")
## ssl support
An auto generated self signed certificate is created at zone init and there is a ready to go nginx conf file that just has to be enabled in: 

    /opt/local/etc/nginx/sites-available/wordpress-ssl.conf
Please note in order for selective cache purge to work with SSL you will need to install a valid SSL Certificate for your site or figure out how to make "curl" ignore SSL validation.
